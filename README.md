# add_cargo_library

CMake function to build and link Rust library code in your C++ ROS project.

To use this you'll need an [install of Rust on your system](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

The example shows building a library out of rust and linking it into a C++ project and calling a rust function from the C++ code.
